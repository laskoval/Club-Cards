Club Card Status Management Program
This C++ program provides a system for managing and processing discount cards for a computer club fundraiser. Each club card is assigned a unique ID, and these cards can exist in one of four status lists: Active, Dead, Watch, or Fraud. The program reads existing "dead" card IDs from a file called "dead.txt" and offers a user-friendly menu for various card management tasks.
